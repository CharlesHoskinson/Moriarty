# Unstable features

Unstable features are experimental compiler capabilities. They may change
or be removed before stabilization.

## Viewing available unstable features

Run `simc --help`; the features are listed under the `-Z` flag.

## Enabling an unstable feature

Pass `-Z <feature-name>` to `simc`.

## Adding or stabilizing a feature

See the rustdoc on `UnstableFeature` in `src/unstable.rs`; the procedures
live next to the code they mutate, so they cannot drift.
